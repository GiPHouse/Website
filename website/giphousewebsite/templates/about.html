    <h4>What is GiPHouse?</h4>
    <p>GiPHouse is a virtual software company of the Radboud University Nijmegen, which has already been active for more than 25 years.
        GiPHouse is entirely run by students and is divided into two parts, which run independently from each other in the spring and fall semesters.</p>

    <h3>Our activities</h3>
    <p>During every first half of the calendar year (spring semester), GiPHouse develops software for paying customers. These projects are completely developed by students, who get credits for successfully participating in the courses that are linked to GiPHouse. Working on these projects is the main focus of the courses. Project teams usually consist of six to eight engineers (bachelor students) and a one to three project managers (master students).</p>
    <p>During the second half of the calendar year (fall semester), a master about beginning a start-up course is given. In this course, students are tasked with developing software around a central theme. This software will hopefully be the start of a real start-up, which could go on even after the course is finished.</p>
    <p>For students, working for GiPHouse is a perfect opportunity to get some real-life experience as a software developer, as a project manager or with creating a start-up.</p>

    <h5>Spring semester</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>From February until July,</li>
        <li>Project engineers (bachelor students),</li>
        <li>Project managers (master students),</li>
        <li>6 ec (168 hours) project work per student and</li>
        <li>Agile development.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Fall semester</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>From September until January,</li>
        <li>For master students,</li>
        <li>6 ec (168 hours) project work per student,</li>
        <li>Course about entrepreneurship and</li>
        <li>Agile development.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Time division and documentation</h4>
    <p>Besides developing the software, we also expect students to spend time on team meetings, meetings with their customers, writing documentation and other important project-related work.</p>

    <p>For the spring semester, we expect students to</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do three sprints, where each sprint finishes with a working product,</li>
        <li>Give three intermediate presentations (one per sprint),</li>
        <li>Write a project plan (way of working),</li>
        <li>Write a design document,</li>
        <li>Write a requirements document,</li>
        <li>Write a technical design document,</li>
        <li>Write a functional design document and</li>
        <li>Document the executed and implemented tests.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For the fall semester, we expect students to</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do three sprints, where each sprint finishes with a working product,</li>
        <li>Give three intermediate presentations,</li>
        <li>Be part of a hackaton/bootcamp at the beginning of the course,</li>
        <li>Start their own company,</li>
        <li>Deliver a working software product/service,</li>
        <li>Use a cloud service as hosting platform,</li>
        <li>Write a project plan (way of working) and</li>
        <li>Document the executed and implemented tests.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The students are usually free to choose their favourite programming language and platform, barring client wishes. Most students have experience with C++, Python and Java but other languages could also be an option.</p>
    <p>At the end of the spring semester, the customer has to judge the quality of the product and the team-customer collaboration. The final grade for the course is an average of the customer judgement and a judgement of the teachers.</p>

    <h4>What is important for you as a customer?</h4>
    <p>Running a project within GiPHouse (spring semester) is possible for only &euro;350,-. This is a fixed price and the money will mainly be used for project-related costs like printing, travelling and administrative costs. We also need to occasionally upgrade or buy new hardware. Note that this money is not used to pay students for their work: they get a reward for their work in the form of credits.</p>
    <p>GiPHouse is working with students and not with paid professionals. This means that we cannot guarantee that every project will be completely up to par with the customers' wishes. By emphasising good communication between students and the customers, we try to give the projects a successful conclusion. We know from experience that most projects are finished or mostly finished and customers are predominantly satisfied with us.</p>
    <p>Please note that handing in a project proposal does not mean that your project will be accepted for development. This is because we do not know in advance how many students will participate in the relevant courses.</p>
